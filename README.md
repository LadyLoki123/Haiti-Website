This project was designed as part of the SUNY Broome Bridge to Haiti support project in Grande-Saline. This site was created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code and techniques taught during a 7-week course. To view, you can download all the files and place them into one folder. The website can be viewed by selecting either of the 3 main HTML pages to view. The CSS style code and JavaScript codes are included in separate files.
The purpose of this site is to be downloaded locally onto student's computers and used to teach basic Microsoft Word skills. There is a review page and a self-quizzing page used to help students to memorize basic vocabulary.
