This project was designed as part of the SUNY Broome Bridge to Haiti support project in Grande-Saline. This site was created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code and techniques taught during a 7-week course. To view, you can download all the files and place them into one folder. The website can be viewed by selecting either of the 3 main HTML pages to view. The CSS style code and JavaScript codes are included in separate files.
